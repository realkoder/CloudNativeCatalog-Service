## Utility Commands
pwd should be appplication root directory.

Boot the spring application
```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```


#### Building a Docker Image with Gradle and Spring Boot
When you run `./gradlew bootBuildImage`, Gradle goes through the following steps:

1. **Build the Project:**
    - Gradle first builds your Spring Boot project, compiling the source code, running tests, and assembling the necessary artifacts.

2. **Create a Docker Image:**
    - Once the project is built, the Spring Boot Gradle Plugin uses the Paketo Buildpacks to create a Docker image for your application. Buildpacks are a framework for transforming application source code into container images. They handle tasks such as dependency resolution, build, and configuration.

3. **Docker Image Configuration:**
    - The Docker image created is configured to run your Spring Boot application using the JAR file generated during the build. The image may include a minimal operating system layer, a JRE (Java Runtime Environment), and any dependencies needed by your application.

4. **Result:**
    - After the process completes, you will have a Docker image for your Spring Boot application that you can run using a container runtime like Docker.


```shell
./gradlew bootBuildImage
```

### Test w gradle
The cli below executes gradle test - run this to run test.
Reason behind the autogenerated test class with 
springboottest annotated is to test that the whole 
spring application can start up without any errors.
```shell
./gradlew test
```

### Use Of Docker

This command will clean-up, as soon as container exits
it gets deleted.
``` shell
docker run --rm my-image
```
